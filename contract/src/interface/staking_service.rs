/// Integrates with the staking pool contract and manages STAKE token assets. The main use
/// cases supported by this interface are:
/// 1. Users can [deposit](StakingService::deposit) NEAR funds to stake.
/// 2. Users can withdraw NEAR funds from [StakeBatch](crate::interface::StakeBatch) that has not yet run.
/// 3. Once the NEAR funds are staked, the account is issued STAKE tokens based on the STAKE token
///    value computed when the [StakeBatch](crate::interface::StakeBatch) is run.
/// 4. Users can [redeem](StakingService::redeem) STAKE tokens for NEAR.
/// 5. Users can cancel their requests to redeem STAKE, i.e., the [RedeemStakeBatch](crate::interface::RedeemStakeBatch)
///    is cancelled.
/// 6. [StakeAccount](crate::interface::StakeAccount) info can be looked up
/// 7. [RedeemStakeBatchReceipt](crate::interface::RedeemStakeBatchReceipt) information for pending staking pool
///    withdrawals for unstaked NEAR can be looked up
/// 8. Batch receipts can be looked for any active receipts which contain unclaimed funds.
///
/// ## How Staking NEAR Works
/// Users [deposit](StakingService::deposit) NEAR funds into a [StakeBatch](crate::interface::StakeBatch).
/// The staking batch workflow is run via [stake()](StakingService::stake), which deposits and stakes
/// the batched NEAR funds with the staking pool. Users have the option to combine the deposit and
/// stake operations via [deposit_and_stake()](StakingService::deposit_and_stake).
///
/// When the batch is run, the STAKE token value at that point in time is computed and recorded into a
/// [StakeBatchReceipt](crate::interface::StakeBatchReceipt). The STAKE tokens are issued on demand when
/// the user accounts access the contract for actions that involve STAKE tokens - when staking NEAR,
/// redeeming STAKE, or withdrawing unstaked NEAR.
///
/// ## How Redeeming STAKE Works
/// Users [redeem](StakingService::redeem) STAKE tokens, which are collected into a
/// [RedeemStakeBatch](crate::interface::RedeemStakeBatch). The redeemed STAKE tokens will need to be
/// unstaked from the staking pool via [unstake()](StakingService::unstake), which processes the
/// [RedeemStakeBatch](crate::interface::RedeemStakeBatch). Users have the option to combine the
/// redeem and unstake operations via [redeem_and_stake()](StakingService::redeem_and_unstake). For
/// convenience users can also simply redeem all STAKE via [redeem_all()](StakingService::redeem) and
/// [redeem_all_and_stake()](StakingService::redeem_all_and_unstake).
///
/// Redeeming STAKE tokens requires NEAR to be unstaked and withdrawn from the staking pool.
/// When NEAR is unstaked, the unstaked NEAR funds are not available for withdrawal until 4 epochs
/// later (~2 days). While waiting for the unstaked NEAR funds to be released and withdrawn,
/// [unstake()](StakingService::unstake) requests will fail.
/// When a [RedeemStakeBatch](crate::interface::RedeemStakeBatch) is run, the STAKE
/// token value is computed at that point in time, which is used to compute the corresponding amount
/// of NEAR tokens to unstake from the staking pool. This information is recorded in a
/// [RedeemStakeBatchReceipt](crate::interface::RedeemStakeBatchReceipt), which is later used by user
/// accounts to claim NEAR tokens from the processed batch.
///
/// ## Notes
/// - Batches are processed serially
/// - Users can continue to submit requests to [deposit](StakingService::deposit) and [redeem](StakingService::redeem)
///   funds and they will be queued into the next batch
/// - batch receipts will be deleted from storage once all funds on the receipt are claimed

    /// NEAR at epoch 103, then the entire 100 unstaked NEAR will be available to be withdrawn at
    /// epoch 107. In this example, in order to be able to withdraw the 50 NEAR at epoch 104, the 2nd
